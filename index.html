                    Were the vikings murderous pillagers and rapists, or were they primarily farmers? Did the vikings
                    believe in Odin, Thor, and Freyr, or are these just historical assumptions? The truth will send you

                        Their boats were technologically unrivalled in their age. They were fast, nimble, and commanded
                        by some of the best naval capable people of the era.

                        Most vikings were actually farmers first and foremost. Going "viking" was secondary to their
                        home lives.

                        Vikings did not have horned helms (probably). This was a legend originating by artists
                        portraying Vikings with horned helmets, hundreds of years after the Viking era.

                        Norse religion (as we know it today) is based on context and assumptions. The belief systems were not written down,
                        rather they were passed down by word of mouth. All we have are accounts by some Christians and
                        historical context to go on.
